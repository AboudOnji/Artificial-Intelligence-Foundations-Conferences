@book{Kim2017,
   abstract = {Get started with MATLAB for deep learning and AI with this in-depth primer. In this book, you start with machine learning fundamentals, then move on to neural networks, deep learning, and then convolutional neural networks. In a blend of fundamentals and applications, MATLAB Deep Learning employs MATLAB as the underlying programming language and tool for the examples and case studies in this book. With this book, you'll be able to tackle some of today's real world big data, smart bots, and other complex data problems. You’ll see how deep learning is a complex and more intelligent aspect of machine learning for modern smart data analysis and usage. What You'll Learn Use MATLAB for deep learning Discover neural networks and multi-layer neural networks Work with convolution and pooling layers Build a MNIST example with these layers Who This Book Is For Those who want to learn deep learning using MATLAB. Some MATLAB experience may be useful.},

@book{Paluszek2020,
   abstract = {Introduction Harness the power of MATLAB for deep-learning challenges. This book provides an introduction to deep learning and using MATLAB’s deep-learning toolboxes. You’ll see how these toolboxes provide the complete set of functions needed to implement all aspects of deep learning. Along the way, you’ll learn to model complex systems, including the stock market, natural language, and angles-only orbit determination. You’ll cover dynamics and control, and integrate deep-learning algorithms and approaches using MATLAB. You’ll also apply deep learning to aircraft navigation using images. Finally, you’ll carry out classification of ballet pirouettes using an inertial measurement unit to experiment with MATLAB’s hardware capabilities. You will: Explore deep learning using MATLAB and compare it to algorithms Write a deep learning function in MATLAB and train it with examples Use MATLAB toolboxes related to deep learning Implement tokamak disruption prediction.},

@book{Mohammed2017,
   abstract = {Machine learning, one of the top emerging sciences, has an extremely broad range of applications. However, many books on the subject provide only a theoretical approach, making it difficult for a newcomer to grasp the subject material. This book provides a more practical approach by explaining the concepts of machine learning algorithms and describing the areas of application for each algorithm, using simple practical examples to demonstrate each algorithm and showing how different issues related to these algorithms are applied.
